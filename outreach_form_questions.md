This document aims to map out a form that we could submit to municipal and local non-profit stakeholders to gather an understanding of problems or issues and possible solutions we could champion at Code for DC.

Which populations are impacted by the problem? Does this problem differentially impact specific populations?

How long has the problem been going on?
