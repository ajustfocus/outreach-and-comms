Dear <receiver_name>,

I hope this email finds you well.

I am contacting you on behalf of <local_org>, a state chapter of <national_org>. As we begin our cycle, we are reaching out to our local community in search of problems that can be addressed through a mixture of technology and a passion for civic engagement.

<local_org> is an entirely volunteer-driven organization that uses technology to address civic and social issues challenging the <region> community. Our volunteers include software developers, designers, product managers, data geeks, and activists. By fostering a space where volunteers can apply technology to address community needs, <local_org> aims to spark interest in civil service careers. Our past projects include building digital tools such as websites and web applications, analyzing data to improve decision-making, and delivering educational programming and training to improve the delivery and accessibility of government and nonprofit services.

We ask you, <receiver_name>, to suggest civic issues impacting <local_org> residents that might benefit from a technological fix. Ideas might include improving enrollment and verification processes for government services, identifying opportunities to better understand barriers inhibiting access to government services for specific populations, and suggestions to encourage resident participation in local government and the policymaking process.

We appreciate your time and consideration and hope to discuss potential project ideas with you in more detail.

Best,

<sender_name>
